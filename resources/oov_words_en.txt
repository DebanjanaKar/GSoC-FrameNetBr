and in all of the people here to somebody in the nativity play of it you're never asked back the people when they got out the three boys our children you ok with that the unpredictability, i think, is extraordinary this man to help them make something of it cats' and 'phantom of the opera tell you how wonderful it was the pencil the blood run from their face vested interest the school it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp about education they could have that it's one of those things that goes deep with people to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. we're being strict about it of this her mother most people the other night the third boy one day they pin you to the wall i lived in stratford-on-avon not see this future asked back about their education jonas salk i bring you myrrh we have a huge vested interest in it, you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education the three kings see the blood run from their face of people like me in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future you work this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did the second boy i've listened to all these things your mother's told me, i need to speak to her privately i bring you gold the gillian lynne dance company in the whole of childhood to be one of the lead parts this future a soloist dinner parties a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity 15 minutes about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson to the music imagine what a seamless transition that was to her to her mother your mother at this point just stand and watch her the first boy so they can face this future about creativity you're not asked from stratford that being wrong is the same thing as being creative some of the scenarios that we've talked about because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp what she could do terry, please, i'm trying to fry an egg in here in the '30s by rachel carson. about the problems gillian was having at school in this room of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson this gift with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, gillian lynne on this chair at the end in 2065 the radio that was sitting on his desk a word from their face to speak to her privately mrs.lynne, gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer to me for it what god looks like they just went out of sequence they'll have a go she had adhd to see this specialist in a place called snitterfield, just outside stratford, which is where shakespeare's father was born the scenarios what the world will look like in five years' time the radio by the whole thing of agents in t-shirts out of the room our creative capacities we think gillian has a learning disorder   one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity what's going to happen, in terms of the future about five years ago by his dad she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood i heard a great story in the end to calm down our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity shakespeare's father you can see the blood run from their face on the final night their whole being to a dance school the room to talk about creativity bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh she did to talk about all these things mel gibson to educate their whole being the past four days in terms of the future exceptional in the whole of childhood a person of extraordinary dedication frank sent this for the hope that they are as we grow up of her 'll never find another girl like sarah a tree all the time grown men and women about the transition that way this year with the same status the doctor why me of the future a  the part of joseph you think of it the revolution she was at school for 20 minutes for the future that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status children starting school this year i'm drawing a picture of god wherever he went, he was four that year her feet i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity out of sequence a wonderful woman you'll never come up with anything original the teacher nobody has a clue children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong to the kids on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation through the conference in a forest on medication four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads how this may play out by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are out the top this future that we can't grasp gillian and i what are you drawing she was really hopeless all the expertise you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, 'what do you do?'and you say you work in education to bed is extraordinary all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days at school to the wall a picture of god to the little boy the discotheque i lived those things a great t-shirt all  a little girl one night which are relevant to what i want to talk about you ask about their education in it on his desk of joseph to talk about
