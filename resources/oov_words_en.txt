turn on have to be like one day go on talk (to) in common where [relativizer] pop in in terms my son to see this specialist from stratford one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity telling it you ask about their education she was really hopeless place called snitterfield their whole being your mother on her hands andrew lloyd webber with the same status for the future one day what's going to happen those things this future the story they could have that her homework on his desk for innovation what god looks like the discotheque it's one of those things that goes deep with people her feet to millions the part of joseph of people like me they just went out of sequence how this may play out the teacher what she could do the radio that was sitting on his desk the other night the minute they left the room tell you how wonderful it was i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity this year the gillian lynne dance company to be educating them for it terry, please, i'm trying to fry an egg in here in the end you can see the blood run from their face in a forest four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads oh my god grown men and women this girl of agents in t-shirts children starting school this year the room that's been on parade about creativity the girl for the hope that they are kids with degrees as we grow up to be one of the lead parts 15 minutes it comes to i lived in stratford-on-avon but nobody knows what god looks like until about five years ago why me in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here in the whole of childhood the school gillian lynne dance company she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future i bring you gold vested interest now they'd say she had adhd world will for the past four days off the beat to educate their whole being you're not prepared to be wrong the place her work out of sequence to all these things your mother's told me the second boy you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, 'what do you do?'and you say you work in education from their face the sequel of agents in t-shirts: not see this future , gillian lynne the people to the wall we all do for their heads while this man talked to her mother about the problems gillian was having at school to talk about creativity our children they'll have a go our creative capacities 'll never find another girl like sarah a picture of god about five years ago i'm drawing a picture of god how did you get to be a dancer to a residential conference of senior academics you're not asked you think of it she had adhd you work in education by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are of the future the thing they were good at at school a dinner party asked back for 20 minutes just stand and watch her as literacy we'll do it to america what the world will look like in five years' time in the nativity play the place crammed full of agents in t-shirts jonas salk the radio bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh is extraordinary to the little boy cats' and 'phantom of the opera the scenarios she was at school to a dance school you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education they don't know to the music i have a big interest in education they pin you to the wall because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp her mother gillian and i by the whole thing that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status of eight a  at this point how wonderful it was to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. to help them make something of it children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 the country to me if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong tap, jazz most people in stratford-on-avon by a new thought pretty ruthlessly they will, in a minute very interesting which are relevant to what i want to talk about my one night out with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have to calm down all these things make something of it the blood run from their face you work we think gillian has a learning disorder for it of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson all the time of the royal ballet our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity to what i want to talk about to carry on playing video games we have a huge vested interest in it, with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, gillian lynne what do you do the three boys of shakespeare that way she did a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity to think frank sent this all the expertise all week to the kids what's going to happen, in terms of the future out the top around the world when they got out in a place called snitterfield, just outside stratford, which is where shakespeare's father was born the teacher to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity the unpredictability imagine what a seamless transition that was i've listened to all these things your mother's told me, i need to speak to her privately the three kings through the conference this gift all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days in this room out of affection for them mel gibson to bed the doctor one night to los angeles we're being strict about it in the '30s career at the royal al gore a wonderful woman dinner parties to her mother on medication for the richness they are the board a great story the revolution the bit where the three kings come in some of the scenarios that we've talked about what are you drawing about five years the first boy james robinson on this chair at the end so they can face this future see this future a soloist mrs.lynne, gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer what happened a word if all the insects were to disappear from the earth, within 50 years all life on earth would end if a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong? to talk about education to her parents the third boy a little girl a tree to remain an artist in it this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did in 2065 of her the past four days royal ballet for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history all  a person of extraordinary dedication it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp to talk about on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation of it those things that goes deep with people four days about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson this future that we can't grasp the unpredictability, i think, is extraordinary having a father on the final night   i lived in terms of the future by his dad a great t-shirt this man in education by rachel carson. of human ecology out of the room of this to speak to her privately about the problems gillian was having at school to take us into this future that we can't grasp about the transition as they went out of the room three themes the pencil the back musical theater productions you're never asked back into this future that we can't grasp to meetings to her yeah, why?was that wrong exceptional in the whole of childhood that all children are born artists for a few minutes i bring you myrrh of joseph all kids have tremendous talents nobody has a clue next to gillian a talent gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh that being wrong is the same thing as being creative about their education wherever he went, he was four that year about it from a number of presentations from the royal ballet school about education you'll never come up with anything original of human creativity to somebody you ok with that see the blood run from their face i heard a great story at school shakespeare's father their head at dinner parties, of god
